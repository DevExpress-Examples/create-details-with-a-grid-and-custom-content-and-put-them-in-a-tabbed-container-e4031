# Create details with a grid and custom content and put them in a tabbed container


<p>This example shows how to setup tabbed details within the Grid Control. On the first tab, the detail section is represented by a GridControl, while the second tab displays a memo field. Thus you will see TabViewDetailDescriptor, DataControlDetailDescriptor and ContentDetailDescriptor objects in action. </p><p>The form first displays one grid that has been set up via XAML code. There's also a button that created a second identical grid in code, so you can learn both ways to add details to the grid. </p>
